# Deception-Detection

Accurate deception detection is crucial for law enforcement officials who are constantly under the radar to get criminals off the streets without impounding innocent suspects. The conventional polygraph can be fooled by a trained individual quite easily. We have come up with a robust solution which combines verbal and non-verbal cues to detect deception.

As we are in the process of getting our work published, the code cannot be shared just yet. You can contact me personally if you'd wish to discuss more.
